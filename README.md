**Sprint Review and Retrospective**

## üìò Portfolio Reflection

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?**  
To interpret user needs, I start by identifying the problem the user wants to solve and gathering detailed requirements. Creating user stories helps break those needs into specific, actionable tasks that a developer can implement. It keeps the user‚Äôs perspective front and center, ensuring the solution aligns with their goals and expectations.

**2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach program development iteratively, beginning with planning and gathering requirements, then moving into design, coding, testing, and reviewing. I found Agile processes like Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, and Sprint Reviews especially helpful. In the future, I hope to incorporate continuous integration, iterative feedback, and close collaboration with stakeholders.

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member means communicating openly, supporting others, and taking ownership of your tasks. It also involves giving and receiving feedback constructively, adapting to change, and working toward the shared goal of delivering a high-quality product.
